# Discord Bot Verification Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for verifying that all components of the Discord bot are working as expected.

## Prerequisites

Before starting verification, ensure that:

- [ ] The `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly
- [ ] The `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is set correctly
- [ ] All required Python packages are installed (`py-cord` 2.6.1, `pymongo`, `motor`, `python-dotenv`)
- [ ] The `.env` file exists with the proper environment variables

## Component Verification

### Core Components

- [ ] Bot can start up without errors (`python run.py --validate-only`)
- [ ] Bot can connect to Discord API (`python run.py` shows "Bot connected to Discord" message)
- [ ] Bot can connect to MongoDB (`python test_components.py` shows MongoDB connection successful)
- [ ] Bot properly handles command-line arguments (`python run.py --help` shows usage instructions)
- [ ] Compatibility layers are properly applied

### Command System

- [ ] Regular commands are working correctly
- [ ] Slash commands are working correctly
- [ ] Hybrid commands are working correctly
- [ ] Command permissions are enforced correctly
- [ ] Command cooldowns are enforced correctly
- [ ] Command error handling is functioning properly

### Database Operations

- [ ] Can read from MongoDB
- [ ] Can write to MongoDB
- [ ] Error handling for database operations works as expected
- [ ] Connection retries work as expected
- [ ] Safe MongoDB operations work as expected

### Event Handling

- [ ] Event listener registration works correctly
- [ ] Event dispatcher can handle all event types
- [ ] Event error handling works as expected
- [ ] Background tasks can be started and managed

### Cogs

- [ ] All cogs can be loaded without errors
- [ ] Cog commands work correctly
- [ ] Cog listeners work correctly
- [ ] Cog background tasks work correctly

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify that:

- [ ] All components validation passes (`python validate_bot.py`)
- [ ] Bot can run without errors for at least 10 minutes
- [ ] Bot handles Discord disconnections gracefully
- [ ] Bot handles database disconnections gracefully
- [ ] Error logging is working properly
- [ ] Environment is properly configured with all required secrets and settings

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Discord Connection Issues

1. **Bot token is invalid or expired**
   - Verify the token in the Discord Developer Portal
   - Regenerate the token if necessary

2. **Network connectivity issues**
   - Check Replit's connectivity to Discord's API
   - Verify there are no IP bans or rate limits

### Database Connection Issues

1. **MongoDB URI is incorrect**
   - Verify the format of the connection string
   - Test the connection string with `mongo` CLI tool

2. **MongoDB credentials are invalid**
   - Verify username and password
   - Ensure the user has proper permissions

### Command Issues

1. **Commands not registering**
   - Check for proper command decorators
   - Verify that command sync is being called

2. **Command permissions not working**
   - Verify the correct permission checks are in place
   - Check bot's role in the server

## Running Verification Tests

To run all verification tests at once:

```bash
python validate_bot.py
```

To run specific component tests:

```bash
python test_components.py
```

For advanced validation with debugging:

```bash
python run.py --validate-only --debug
```

## Version Compatibility Notes

- Bot is designed to work with `py-cord` 2.6.1
- For MongoDB compatibility, use version 4.x or newer
- Python 3.8+ is required (3.11 recommended)
