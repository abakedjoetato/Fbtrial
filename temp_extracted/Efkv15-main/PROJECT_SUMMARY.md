# Discord Bot Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a Discord bot using py-cord, a fork of discord.py. It includes both a simplified implementation and a more complex version with a compatibility layer to support migration from discord.py to py-cord.

## Key Components

1. **Simple Bot Implementation**
   - `simple_bot.py`: A standalone bot implementation with basic commands
   - `main.py`: Main entry point that runs the simple bot

2. **Advanced Bot Implementation**
   - `bot.py`: Full-featured bot with modular components
   - `discord_compat_layer.py`: Compatibility layer for discord.py to py-cord migration
   - `cogs/`: Directory for command modules

3. **Support Scripts**
   - `replit_run.py`: Direct runner script for Replit environment
   - `run_simple_bot.py`: Runner with web interface
   - `setup.py`: Environment setup script

## Setup Process

1. **Library Setup**
   - Installed py-cord 2.6.1 and its dependencies
   - Configured compatibility with older discord.py code

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up DISCORD_TOKEN in Replit Secrets
   - Created run scripts for different environments

3. **Bot Structure**
   - Implemented modular command system
   - Added error handling and automatic reconnection
   - Created web monitoring interface

## Running the Bot

The bot can be run in several ways:

1. **Direct Execution**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Using Runner Script**
   ```
   ./run.sh
   ```

3. **Web Interface**
   ```
   python run_simple_bot.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Full Cog Implementation**
   - Migrate all commands to the cog system
   - Implement advanced features in modular cogs

2. **Database Integration**
   - Complete MongoDB integration
   - Implement data persistence

3. **Enhanced Web Interface**
   - Add command statistics
   - Improve monitoring capabilities

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Bot Not Connecting**
   - Check DISCORD_TOKEN in Replit Secrets
   - Verify internet connectivity

2. **Commands Not Working**
   - Ensure proper command prefix is used
   - Check bot permissions in Discord server

3. **Bot Crashes**
   - Review error logs in bot.log
   - Check for API rate limiting issues
